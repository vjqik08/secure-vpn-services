## FAQ

**Do VPN services actually slow down internet speeds significantly?**

Modern premium VPNs like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and ProtonVPN cause minimal speed loss—typically 5-10% reduction in download speeds—barely noticeable during normal browsing, streaming, or gaming. The encryption overhead and server distance introduce slight latency, but quality providers compensate through optimized protocols and high-capacity server infrastructure. Budget VPNs often cause 30-50% speed loss through overloaded servers and inefficient routing. Test speeds with VPN disconnected, then connected to nearby servers—premium services maintain 90%+ of baseline speeds, while poor VPNs cut speeds dramatically. Choose providers with proprietary protocols like NordLynx or Lightway optimized specifically for speed.

**Can law enforcement or government agencies actually break VPN encryption?**

Military-grade AES-256 encryption used by reputable VPNs remains mathematically unbreakable with current technology—even nation-state adversaries with supercomputers cannot decrypt properly implemented encryption within practical timeframes. However, governments can compel VPN providers to install monitoring equipment or hand over logs when companies operate in their jurisdictions. Choose providers headquartered in privacy-friendly countries like Panama (NordVPN), British Virgin Islands (ExpressVPN), or Switzerland (ProtonVPN) outside intelligence-sharing alliances, and verify strict no-logs policies undergo independent audits. The encryption itself is secure—the vulnerability comes from providers storing data governments can seize.

**What's the real difference between free VPNs and paid VPN services?**

Free VPNs typically monetize through selling user data to advertisers, injecting ads into browsing sessions, or imposing severe bandwidth caps forcing upgrades—defeating privacy purposes entirely. They operate overloaded servers causing terrible speeds, offer limited locations hindering content access, and provide weak encryption vulnerable to attacks. ProtonVPN offers the only reputable free tier with unlimited bandwidth but speed limitations—acceptable for basic privacy without streaming. Paid VPNs invest in infrastructure, maintain strict no-logs policies, provide 24/7 support, and deliver consistent fast speeds. If privacy matters, paying $2-5 monthly for legitimate service proves worthwhile versus trusting "free" providers secretly selling your data.
